Introduction</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qpb_purpose"></a>
Purpose</h2>
<p>This package uses a primal-dual interior-point trust-region method to solve the <b>quadratic programming problem</b> </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[\mbox{minimize}\;\; q(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T H x + g^T x + f \]
</p>
<p>  subject to the general linear constraints </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[c_i^l \leq a_i^Tx \leq c_i^u, \;\;\; i = 1, \ldots , m,\]
</p>
<p>  and the simple bound constraints </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[x_j^l \leq x_j \leq x_j^u, \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,\]
</p>
<p>  where the \(n\) by \(n\) symmetric matrix \(H\), the vectors \(g\), \(a_i\), \(c^l\), \(c^u\), \(x^l\), \(x^u\) and the scalar \(f\) are given. Any of the constraint bounds \(c_i^l\), \(c_i^u\), \(x_j^l\) and \(x_j^u\) may be infinite. Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix \(H\) or the matrix \(A\) of vectors \(a_i\).</p>
<p>If the matrix \(H\) is positive semi-definite, a global solution is found. However, if \(H\) is indefinite, the procedure may find a (weak second-order) critical point that is not the global solution to the given problem.</p>

Terminology</h2>
<p>The required solution \(x\) necessarily satisfies the primal optimality conditions </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[\mbox{(1a) $\hspace{66mm} A x = c\hspace{66mm}$}\]
</p>
<p>  and </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[\mbox{(1b) $\hspace{52mm} c^l \leq c \leq c^u, \;\; x^l \leq x \leq x^u,\hspace{52mm}$} \]

</p>
<p>  where the vectors \(y\) and \(z\) are known as the Lagrange multipliers for2 the general linear constraints, and the dual variables for the bounds, respectively, and where the vector inequalities hold component-wise.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qpb_method"></a>
Method</h2>
<p>Primal-dual interior point methods iterate towards a point that satisfies these conditions by ultimately aiming to satisfy (1a), (2a) and (3), while ensuring that (1b) and (2b) are satisfied as strict inequalities at each stage. Appropriate norms of the amounts by which (1a), (2a) and (3) fail to be satisfied are known as the primal and dual infeasibility, and the violation of complementary slackness, respectively. The fact that (1b) and (2b) are satisfied as strict inequalities gives such methods their other title, namely interior-point methods.</p>
<p>The problem is solved in two phases. The goal of the first "initial
  feasible point" phase is to find a strictly interior point which is primal feasible, that is that {1a} is satisfied. The GALAHAD package LSQP is used for this purpose, and offers the options of either accepting the first strictly feasible point found, or preferably of aiming for the so-called "analytic center" of the feasible region. Having found such a suitable initial feasible point, the second "optimality" phase ensures that \req{4.1a} remains satisfied while iterating to satisfy dual feasibility (2a) and complementary slackness (3). The optimality phase proceeds by approximately minimizing a sequence of barrier functions   
  $$\frac{1}{2} x^T H x + g^T x + f -
   \mu \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} \log ( c_{i}  -  c_{i}^{l} )
   + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \log ( c_{i}^{u}  -  c_{i} )
   + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \log ( x_{j}  -  x_{j}^{l} ) 
   + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \log ( x_{j}^{u}  -  x_{j} ) \right],$$
  for an approriate sequence of positive barrier parameters \(\mu\) converging to zero while ensuring that (1a) remain satisfied and that \(x\) and \(c\) are strictly interior points for (1b). Note that terms in the above sumations corresponding to infinite bounds are ignored, and that equality constraints are treated specially.</p>
<p>Each of the barrier subproblems is solved using a trust-region method. Such a method generates a trial correction step \(\Delta (x, c)\) to the current iterate \((x, c)\) by replacing the nonlinear barrier function locally by a suitable quadratic model, and approximately minimizing this model in the intersection of \req{4.1a} and a trust region \(\|\Delta (x, c)\| \leq \Delta\) for some appropriate strictly positive trust-region radius \(\Delta\) and norm \(\| \cdot \|\). The step is accepted/rejected and the radius adjusted on the basis of how accurately the model reproduces the value of barrier function at the trial step. If the step proves to be unacceptable, a linesearch is performed along the step to obtain an acceptable new iterate. In practice, the natural primal "Newton" model of the barrier function is frequently less successful than an alternative primal-dual model, and consequently the primal-dual model is usually to be preferred.</p>
<p>Once a barrier subproblem has been solved, extrapolation based on values and derivatives encountered on the central path is optionally used to determine a good starting point for the next subproblem. Traditional Taylor-series extrapolation has been superceded by more accurate Puiseux-series methods as these are particularly suited to deal with degeneracy.</p>
<p>The trust-region subproblem is approximately solved using the combined conjugate-gradient/Lanczos method implemented in the GALAHAD package GLTR. Such a method requires a suitable preconditioner, and in our case, the only flexibility we have is in approximating the model of the Hessian. Although using a fixed form of preconditioning is sometimes effective, we have provided the option of an automatic choice, that aims to balance the cost of applying the preconditioner against the needs for an accurate solution of the trust-region subproblem. The preconditioner is applied using the GALAHAD matrix factorization package SBLS, but options at this stage are to factorize the preconditioner as a whole (the so-called "augmented system" approach), or to perform a block elimination first (the "Schur-complement" approach). The latter is usually to be prefered when a (non-singular) diagonal preconditioner is used, but may be inefficient if any of the columns of \(A\) is too dense.</p>
<p>In order to make the solution as efficient as possible, the variables and constraints are reordered internally by the GALAHAD package QPP prior to solution. In particular, fixed variables, and free (unbounded on both sides) constraints are temporarily removed.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="main_unsymmetric_matrices"></a>
Unsymmetric matrix storage formats</h2>
<p>The unsymmetric \(m\) by \(n\) constraint matrix \(A\) may be presented and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.</p>
<p>Both C-style (0 based) and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed. Choose <code>control.f_indexing</code> as <code>false</code> for C style and <code>true</code> for fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to indices for the corresponding fortran version.</p>
<p>Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="unsymmetric_matrix_dense"></a>
Dense storage format</h3>
<p>The matrix \(A\) is stored as a compact dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array. In this case, component \(n \ast i + j\) of the storage array A_val will hold the value \(A_{ij}\) for \(0 \leq i \leq m-1\), \(0 \leq j \leq n-1\).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate"></a>
Sparse co-ordinate storage format</h3>
<p>Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored. For the \(l\)-th entry, \(0 \leq l \leq ne-1\), of \(A\), its row index i, column index j and value \(A_{ij}\), \(0 \leq i \leq m-1\), \(0 \leq j \leq n-1\), are stored as the \(l\)-th components of the integer arrays A_row and A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as A_ne = \(ne\).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise"></a>
Sparse row-wise storage format</h3>
<p>Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those in row i+1. For the i-th row of \(A\) the i-th component of the integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row, while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries plus one. The column indices j, \(0 \leq j \leq n-1\), and values \(A_{ij}\) of the nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components l = A_ptr(i), \(\ldots\), A_ptr(i+1)-1, \(0 \leq i \leq m-1\), of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively. For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than its predecessor.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="main_symmetric_matrices"></a>
Symmetric matrix storage formats</h2>
<p>Likewise, the symmetric \(n\) by \(n\) objective Hessian matrix \(H\) may be presented and stored in a variety of formats. But crucially symmetry is exploited by only storing values from the lower triangular part (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="symmetric_matrix_dense"></a>
Dense storage format</h3>
<p>The matrix \(H\) is stored as a compact dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array. Since \(H\) is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part \(h_{ij}\) for \(0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\)) need be held. In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is component \(i \ast i / 2 + j\) of the storage array H_val will hold the value \(h_{ij}\) (and, by symmetry, \(h_{ji}\)) for \(0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="symmetric_matrix_coordinate"></a>
Sparse co-ordinate storage format</h3>
<p>Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored. For the \(l\)-th entry, \(0 \leq l \leq ne-1\), of \(H\), its row index i, column index j and value \(h_{ij}\), \(0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\), are stored as the \(l\)-th components of the integer arrays H_row and H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as H_ne = \(ne\). Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="symmetric_matrix_row_wise"></a>
Sparse row-wise storage format</h3>
<p>Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those in row i+1. For the i-th row of \(H\) the i-th component of the integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row, while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one. The column indices j, \(0 \leq j \leq i\), and values \(h_{ij}\) of the entries in the i-th row are stored in components l = H_ptr(i), \(\ldots\), H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively. Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored. For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than its predecessor.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="symmetric_matrix_diagonal"></a>
Diagonal storage format</h3>
<p>If \(H\) is diagonal (i.e., \(H_{ij} = 0\) for all \(0 \leq i \neq j \leq n-1\)) only the diagonals entries \(H_{ii}\), \(0 \leq i \leq n-1\) need be stored, and the first n components of the array H_val may be used for the purpose.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="symmetric_matrix_scaled_identity"></a>
Multiples of the identity storage format</h3>
<p>If \(H\) is a multiple of the identity matrix, (i.e., \(H = \alpha I\) where \(I\) is the n by n identity matrix and \(\alpha\) is a scalar), it suffices to store \(\alpha\) as the first component of H_val.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="symmetric_matrix_identity"></a>
The identity matrix format</h3>
<p>If \(H\) is the identity matrix, no values need be stored.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="symmetric_matrix_zero"></a>
The zero matrix format</h3>
<p>The same is true if \(H\) is the zero matrix. </p>
