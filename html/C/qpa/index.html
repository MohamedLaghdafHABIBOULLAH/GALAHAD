Introduction</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qpa_purpose"></a>
Purpose</h2>
<p>This package uses a working-set method to solve the <b> \(\ell_1\) quadratic programming problem</b>   
  $$
(1)\;\;\min_{x \in R^n} q(x) + \rho_g v_g(x) +\rho_b v_b(x)
  $$
  involving the quadratic objective   
  $$
  q(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T H x + g^T x + f
  $$
  and the infeasibilities   
  $$
v_g(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \max ( c_i^l - a_i^T x, 0 ) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \max ( a_i^T x - c_i^u, 0 )
  $$
  and   
  $$
v_b(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \max ( x_j^l - x_j, 0 )
 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \max ( x_j  - x_j^u , 0 ),
  $$
  where the \(n\) by \(n\) symmetric matrix \(H\), the vectors \(g\), \(a_i\), \(c^l\), \(c^u\), \(x^l\), \(x^u\) and the scalar \(f\) are given. Any of the constraint bounds \(c_i^l\), \(c_i^u\), \(x_j^l\) and \(x_j^u\) may be infinite. Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix \(H\) or the matrix \(A\) of vectors \(a_i\).</p>
<p>The package may also be used to solve the <b>quadratic programming problem</b> </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[(2) \;\; \mbox{minimize}\;\; q(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T H x + g^T x + f \]
</p>
<p>  subject to the general linear constraints </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[(3) \;\; c_i^l \leq a_i^Tx \leq c_i^u, \;\;\; i = 1, \ldots , m,\]
</p>
<p>  and the simple bound constraints </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[(4) \;\; x_j^l \leq x_j \leq x_j^u, \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,\]
</p>
<p>  by automatically adjusting \(\rho_b\) in (1).</p>
<p>Similarly, the package is capable of solving the <b>bound-constrained \(\ell_1\) quadratic programming problem</b>   
  $$
  (5) \;\; \min{x \in R^n} q(x) + \rho_g v_g(x),
  $$
</p>
<p> subject to the simple bound constraints (4), by automatically adjusting \(\rho_b\) in (1).</p>
<p>If the matrix \(H\) is positive semi-definite, a global solution is found. However, if \(H\) is indefinite, the procedure may find a (weak second-order) critical point that is not the global solution to the given problem.</p>
<p><b>N.B.</b> In many cases, the alternative GALAHAD quadratic programming package QPB is faster, and thus to be preferred.</p>

<p>  where the diagonal matrix \(W^2\) has diagonal entries \(w_j^2\), \(j = 1, \ldots , n\), where the vectors \(y\) and \(z\) are known as the Lagrange multipliers for the general linear constraints, and the dual variables for the bounds, respectively, and where the vector inequalities hold component-wise.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qpb_method"></a>
Method</h2>
<p>At the \(k\)-th iteration of the method, an improvement to the value of the merit function \(m(x, \rho_g, \rho_b ) = q(x) + \rho_g v_g(x) + \rho_b v_b(x)\) at \(x = x^{(k)}\) is sought. This is achieved by first computing a search direction \(s^{(k)}\), and then setting \(x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + \alpha^{(k)} s^{(k)}\), where the stepsize \(\alpha^{(k)}\) is chosen as the first local minimizer of \(\phi(\alpha) = m( x^{(k)} + \alpha s^{(k)} , \rho_g, \rho_b )\) as \(\alpha\) incesases from zero. The stepsize calculation is straightforward, and exploits the fact that \(\phi ( \alpha )\) is a piecewise quadratic function of \(\alpha\).</p>
<p>The search direction is defined by a subset of the "active" terms in \(v(x)\), i.e., those for which \(a_i^T x = c_i^l\) or \(c_i^u\) (for \(i=1,\ldots ,m\)) or \(x_j = x_j^l\) or \(x_j^u\) (for {j=1,\ldots ,n}). The "working" set \(W^{(k)}\) is chosen from the active terms, and is such that its members have linearly independent gradients. The search direction \(s^{(k)}\) is chosen as an approximate solution of the equality-constrained quadratic program   
  $$
  (6) \;\; \min{s \in R^n} q(x^{(k)} + s) + 
   \rho_g l_g^{(k)} (s) + \rho_b l_b^{(k)} (s),
  $$
  subject to   
  $$
  (7) \;\; a_i^T s = 0,\;\;  i \in \{ 1, \ldots , m \} \cap W^{(k)},
  \;\mbox{and}\;
  x_j = 0, \;\;  i  \in \{1, \ldots , n \} \cap W^{(k)},
  $$
  where   
  $$
  l_g^{(k)} (s) = 
       - \sum_{\stackrel{i=1}{a_i^T x < c_i^l}}^m a_i^T s 
      \; + \sum_{\stackrel{i=1}{a_i^T x > c_i^u}}^m a_i^T s
  $$
  and   
  $$
  l_b^{(k)} (s) = - \sum_{\stackrel{j=1}{x_j < x_j^l}}^n s_j
      \; + \sum_{\stackrel{j=1}{x_j > x_j^u}}^n s_j.
  $$
  The equality-constrained quadratic program (6)-(7) is solved by a projected preconditioned conjugate gradient method. The method terminates either after a prespecified number of iterations, or if the solution is found, or if a direction of infinite descent, along which \(q(x^{(k)} + s) + \rho_g l_g^{(k)} (s) + \rho_b l_b^{(k)} (s)\) decreases without bound within the feasible region (7), is located. Succesively more accurate approximations are required as suspected solutions of (1) are approached.</p>
<p>Preconditioning of the conjugate gradient iteration requires the solution of one or more linear systems of the form   
  $$
  (8) \begin{pmatrix} M^{(k)} & A^{(k)T} \\ A^{(k)} & 0 \end{pmatrix}
      \begin{pmatrix} p \\ u \end{pmatrix} =
      \begin{pmatrix} g \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
  $$
  where \(M^{(k)}\) is a "suitable" approximation to \(H\) and the rows of \(A^{(k)}\) comprise the gradients of the terms in the current working set. Rather than recomputing a factorization of the preconditioner at every iteration, a Schur complement method is used, recognising the fact that gradual changes occur to successive working sets. The main iteration is divided into a sequence of "major" iterations. At the start of each major iteration (say, the overall iteration \(l\)), a factorization of the current "reference" matrix, that is the matrix   
  $$
  (9) \begin{pmatrix} M^{(l)} & A^{(l)T} \\ A^{(l)} & 0 \end{pmatrix}
  $$
  is obtained using the GALAHAD matrix factorization package SLS. This reference matrix may be factorized as a whole (the so-called "augmented system" approach), or by performing a block elimination first (the "Schur-complement" approach). The latter is usually to be preferred when a (non-singular) diagonal preconditioner is used, but may be inefficient if any of the columns of \(A^{(l)}\) is too dense. Subsequent iterations within the current major iteration obtain solutions to (8) via the factors of (9) and an appropriate (dense) Schur complement, obtained from the GALAHAD package SCU. The major iteration terminates once the space required to hold the factors of the (growing) Schur complement exceeds a given threshold.</p>
<p>The working set changes by (a) adding an active term encountered during the determination of the stepsize, or (b) the removal of a term if \(s = 0\) solves (6)-(7). The decision on which to remove in the latter case is based upon the expected decrease upon the removal of an individual term, and this information is available from the magnitude and sign of the components of the auxiliary vector \(u\) computed in (8). At optimality, the components of \(u\) for \(a_i\) terms will all lie between \(0\) and \(\rho_g\)&mdash;and those for the other terms between \(0\) and \(\rho_b\)&mdash;and any violation of this rule indicates further progress is possible. The components of \(u\) corresonding to the terms involving \(a_i^T x\) are sometimes known as Lagrange multipliers (or generalized gradients) and denoted by \(y\), while those for the remaining \(x_j\) terms are dual variables and denoted by \(z\).</p>
<p>To solve (2)-(4), a sequence of problems of the form (1) are solved, each with a larger value of \(\rho_g\) and/or \(\rho_b\) than its predecessor. The required solution has been found once the infeasibilities \(v_g(x)\) and \(v_b(x)\) have been reduced to zero at the solution of (1) for the given \(\rho_g\) and \(\rho_b\).</p>
<p>In order to make the solution as efficient as possible, the variables and constraints are reordered internally by the GALAHAD package QPP prior to solution. In particular, fixed variables and free (unbounded on both sides) constraints are temporarily removed.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="main_unsymmetric_matrices"></a>
Unsymmetric matrix storage formats</h2>
<p>The unsymmetric \(m\) by \(n\) constraint matrix \(A\) may be presented and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.</p>
<p>Both C-style (0 based) and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed. Choose <code>control.f_indexing</code> as <code>false</code> for C style and <code>true</code> for fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to indices for the corresponding fortran version.</p>
<p>Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="unsymmetric_matrix_dense"></a>
Dense storage format</h3>
<p>The matrix \(A\) is stored as a compact dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array. In this case, component \(n \ast i + j\) of the storage array A_val will hold the value \(A_{ij}\) for \(0 \leq i \leq m-1\), \(0 \leq j \leq n-1\).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate"></a>
Sparse co-ordinate storage format</h3>
<p>Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored. For the \(l\)-th entry, \(0 \leq l \leq ne-1\), of \(A\), its row index i, column index j and value \(A_{ij}\), \(0 \leq i \leq m-1\), \(0 \leq j \leq n-1\), are stored as the \(l\)-th components of the integer arrays A_row and A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as A_ne = \(ne\).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise"></a>
Sparse row-wise storage format</h3>
<p>Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those in row i+1. For the i-th row of \(A\) the i-th component of the integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row, while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries plus one. The column indices j, \(0 \leq j \leq n-1\), and values \(A_{ij}\) of the nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components l = A_ptr(i), \(\ldots\), A_ptr(i+1)-1, \(0 \leq i \leq m-1\), of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively. For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than its predecessor.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="main_symmetric_matrices"></a>
Symmetric matrix storage formats</h2>
<p>Likewise, the symmetric \(n\) by \(n\) objective Hessian matrix \(H\) may be presented and stored in a variety of formats. But crucially symmetry is exploited by only storing values from the lower triangular part (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="symmetric_matrix_dense"></a>
Dense storage format</h3>
<p>The matrix \(H\) is stored as a compact dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array. Since \(H\) is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part \(h_{ij}\) for \(0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\)) need be held. In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is component \(i \ast i / 2 + j\) of the storage array H_val will hold the value \(h_{ij}\) (and, by symmetry, \(h_{ji}\)) for \(0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="symmetric_matrix_coordinate"></a>
Sparse co-ordinate storage format</h3>
<p>Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored. For the \(l\)-th entry, \(0 \leq l \leq ne-1\), of \(H\), its row index i, column index j and value \(h_{ij}\), \(0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\), are stored as the \(l\)-th components of the integer arrays H_row and H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as H_ne = \(ne\). Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="symmetric_matrix_row_wise"></a>
Sparse row-wise storage format</h3>
<p>Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those in row i+1. For the i-th row of \(H\) the i-th component of the integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row, while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one. The column indices j, \(0 \leq j \leq i\), and values \(h_{ij}\) of the entries in the i-th row are stored in components l = H_ptr(i), \(\ldots\), H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively. Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored. For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than its predecessor.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="symmetric_matrix_diagonal"></a>
Diagonal storage format</h3>
<p>If \(H\) is diagonal (i.e., \(H_{ij} = 0\) for all \(0 \leq i \neq j \leq n-1\)) only the diagonals entries \(H_{ii}\), \(0 \leq i \leq n-1\) need be stored, and the first n components of the array H_val may be used for the purpose.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="symmetric_matrix_scaled_identity"></a>
Multiples of the identity storage format</h3>
<p>If \(H\) is a multiple of the identity matrix, (i.e., \(H = \alpha I\) where \(I\) is the n by n identity matrix and \(\alpha\) is a scalar), it suffices to store \(\alpha\) as the first component of H_val.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="symmetric_matrix_identity"></a>
The identity matrix format</h3>
<p>If \(H\) is the identity matrix, no values need be stored.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="symmetric_matrix_zero"></a>
The zero matrix format</h3>
<p>The same is true if \(H\) is the zero matrix. </p>
