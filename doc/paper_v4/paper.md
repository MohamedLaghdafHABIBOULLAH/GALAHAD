# Summary

This is work in progress!!

Solving mathematical optimization problems is a critical task for many areas of study.
[`GALAHAD`](https://github.com/ralna/GALAHAD) is easy to install using its 
own make-based system. 
Fortran documentation is provided in PDF via LaTeX, while both PDF and
man documents for the C packages using doxygen.

# State of the field

# Statement of need

The first release of the Fortran 90 GALAHAD [@GoulOrbaToin03] library in 2003 
aimed to  expand the functionality of the earlier Fortran 77 
LANCELOT [@ConnGoulToin92] package for nonlinear optimization. 
Subsequent releases focused on increasing the scope of solvers provided,
but aside from limited interfaces to Matlab and to the 
CUTEst [@GoulOrbaToin15] modelling library, little effort was made to
bridge the gap between Fortran and other, often more recent and popular, 
programming languages.

The main benefits of this package are:
* Benefit 1
* Benefit 2
