introduction to function calls
------------------------------

To solve a given problem, functions from the xxx package must be 
called in the following order:


See the :ref:`examples <doxid-index_xxx_examples>` section for 
illustrations of use.

parametric real type T
----------------------

Below, the symbol T refers to a parametric real type that may be Float32
(single precision) or Float64 (double precision).
Calable functions as described are with T as Float64, but variants 
(with the additional suffix ``_s``, e.g., ``xxx_initialize_s``) 
are available with T as Float32.

the code is available in $GALAHAD/src/xxx/Julia/test_xxx.jl .
A variety of supported Hessian and constraint matrix storage formats are shown.
