 *  ugo_solve, a method for finding the global minimizer of a univariate

 *   Daniela Lera and Yaroslav D. Sergeyev,
 *   "Acceleration of univariate global optimization algorithms working with
 *    Lipschitz functions and Lipschitz first derivatives"
 *   SIAM J. Optimization Vol. 23, No. 1, pp. 508â€“529 (2013)

 *
 *   x_l and x_u are scalars of type double, that hold the bound on the
 *    search interval [x_l,x_u]
 *
 *   x is a scalar pointer of type double, that holds the next value of x at
 *    which the user is required to evaluate the objective (and its derivatives)
 *    when inform.status > 0, or the value of the approximate global minimizer
 *    when inform.status = 0
 *
 *   f is a scalar pointer of type double, that must be set by the user to hold
 *    the value of f(x) if required by inform.status > 0 (see below), and will
 *    return the value of the approximate global minimum when inform.status = 0
 *
 *   g is a scalar pointer of type double, that must be set by the user to hold
 *    the value of f'(x) if required by inform.status > 0 (see below), and will
 *    return the value of the first derivative of f at the approximate global
 *    minimizer when inform.status = 0
 *
 *   h is a scalar pointer of type double, that must be set by the user to hold
 *    the value of f''(x) if required by inform.status > 0 (see below), and will
 *    return the value of the second derivative of f at the approximate global
 *    minimizer when inform.status = 0
 *
 * control is a struct of type ugo_control_type. See above for details
 *
 * inform is a struct of type ugo_inform_type. See above 
 *  for further details. On initial entry, inform.status should be set to 1.
 *  The user must check the value of inform.status on exit, and if required
 *  provide further information and re-enter the function. Possible values
 *  are:
 *
 *     0. The run was succesful
 *
 *    -1. An allocation error occurred. A message indicating the offending
 *        array is written on unit control.error, and the returned allocation
 *        status and a string containing the name of the offending array
 *        are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
 *    -2. A deallocation error occurred.  A message indicating the offending
 *        array is written on unit control.error and the returned allocation
 *        status and a string containing the name of the offending array
 *        are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
 *    -7. The objective function appears to be unbounded from below
 *   -18. Too many iterations have been performed. This may happen if
 *        control.maxit is too small, but may also be symptomatic of
 *        a badly scaled problem.
 *   -19. The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen if
 *        control.cpu_time_limit is too small, but may also be symptomatic of
 *        a badly scaled problem.
 *   -40. The user has forced termination of solver by removing the file named
 *        control.alive_file from unit unit control.alive_unit.
 *
 *     2. The user should compute the objective function value f(x) at the point
 *        x and then re-enter the function. The required value should be set
 *        in f, and inform.eval_status should be set to 0.
 *        If the user is unable to evaluate f(x) - for instance, if the function
 *        is undefined at x - the user need not set f, but should then set
 *        inform.eval_status to a non-zero value.
 *     3. The user should compute the objective function value f(x) and its
 *        derivative f'(x) at the point x and then re-enter the function.
 *        The required values should be set in f and g respectively,
 *        and inform.eval_status should be set to 0.
 *        If the user is unable to evaluate f(x) or f'(x) - for instance, if the
 *        function or its derivative is undefined at x - the user need not
 *        set f or g, but should then set inform.eval_status to a non-zero value.
 *     4. The user should compute the objective function value f(x) and its
 *        first two derivatives f'(x) and f''(x) at the point x and then
 *        re-enter the function. The required values should be set in f, g
 *        and h respectively, and inform.eval_status should be set to 0. If the
 *        user is unable to evaluate f(x), f'(x) or f''(x) - for instance, if
 *        the function or its derivatives are undefined at x - the user need not
 *        set f, g or h, but should then set inform.eval_status to a non-zero value
 *
 *  data is used for internal data.
 *
 *  userdata is an optional user-defined struct that may be NULL. If non-NULL, it is
 *   used to pass user data to the eval_fgh function (see below).
 * 
 *  eval_fgh is an optional function that may be NULL. If non-NULL, it must have the
 *   signature given below: 
 * 
 *     int eval_fgh(double x, double *f, double *g, double *h, const void *userdata)
 * 
 *   The value of the objective
 *   function f(x) and its first two derivative f'(x) and f''(x) evaluated at
 *   x=x must be assigned to f, g and h respectively, and the function return value
 *   set to 0. If the evaluation is impossible at x, return should be set to a
 *   nonzero value. If eval_fgh is NULL, ugo_solve will return to the
 *   user with inform.status = 4 each time an evaluation is required.
